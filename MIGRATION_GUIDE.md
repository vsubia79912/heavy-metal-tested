You'll need to create a Sanity project and get your credentials:

2. Create a new project
3. Copy your Project ID and Dataset name
4. Create `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at http://localhost:3000

### 4. Set up Sanity Studio
```bash
# Install Sanity CLI globally
npm install -g @sanity/cli

# Initialize Sanity in your project
npx sanity init

# Start Sanity Studio
npx sanity dev
```

The Sanity Studio will be available at http://localhost:3333

## 📝 Creating Blog Posts with AI

### Option 1: Manual Copy-Paste (Available Now)
1. Use AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate blog content
2. Copy the content into Sanity Studio
3. Add SEO fields (title, meta description)
4. Publish

### Option 2: API Integration (Future Enhancement)
You can enhance the Sanity Studio with custom inputs that call AI APIs directly.

### Example Blog Post Prompt
```
Write a blog post about heavy metal contamination in children's toys. Include:
- Introduction to the problem
- Common heavy metals found in toys
- Health risks for children
- How to identify safe toys
- Testing and certification importance
- Conclusion with actionable advice

Make it 800-1000 words, informative but accessible to parents.
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adding New Components
1. Create component in `src/components/`
2. Import and use in pages

### Modifying Blog Schema
1. Edit `sanity/schema.ts`
2. Redeploy Sanity Studio

### SEO Enhancements

## 🚨 Current Limitations & Next Steps
